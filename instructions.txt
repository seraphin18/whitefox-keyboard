1. Use Input-Club's configurator for key mapping
  See input-config directory for details
2. Use Karabiner-Elements for key swapping
  After step #1, there's one key left with a problem
  `(grave accent and tilde) is input as ยง(Section sign)
  this is probably due to wrong keyboard language detection.
  Use Karabiner-Elements to add one rule in simple modification:
  From Key                 To key
  non_us_backslash         grave_accent_and_tilde(`)
